#Cookese

Welcome to Cookese!
This app utilizes a spaced repetition algorithm designed to adapt to users learning needs.
Cookese was created to learn useful kitchen tools! If the user gives right answers to the questions more often those questions will be asked later. If the user tends to give wrong will be asked sooner.
Cookese was implemented using linked list data structure to store the questions (pictures) in the database. When the user answers a question correctly the “memory value”, which is initialized as a value of 1, is doubled and that question moves m # of spaces back in the list. Otherwise, “memory value” will reset to 1 and the user will see that question again after the next question in queue. The better you get to know your kitchen tools the fewer times you will see a question!!
